## Introduction

This page contains all reports and assignments submitted for the Geometric Modeling class. The course covers fundamental concepts in geometric modeling, including:

+ Mathematical foundations of curves and surfaces
+ Bézier curves and B-splines
+ NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines)
+ Surface modeling techniques
+ Mesh generation and processing
+ Geometric algorithms and data structures
